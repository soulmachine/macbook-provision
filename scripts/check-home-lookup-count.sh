# CLAUDE.md states how many places the roles read `lookup('env', 'HOME')`, because that
# count is the whole argument for "never fan this playbook out" — Ansible resolves every
# lookup() on the control node, so each one is a place another host's $HOME would leak in.
#
# The number drifts the moment a role gains or loses a lookup, and it has: it was
# corrected to 87 on 2026-09-15 and was wrong again hours later, when a fix to the hermes
# role added two `chdir: "{{ lookup('env', 'HOME') }}/..."` lines. A doc claim nobody can
# check is a doc claim that rots, so check it.
#
# Deliberately checks ONE number. CLAUDE.md used to carry a second ("convert all 79
# lookups"), fourteen lines below the first and disagreeing with it; that one was reworded
# to carry no figure at all rather than be kept in sync.
