"""Report skill-store directories the `skills` role will never refresh again.

`skills add` never deletes, so a skill that leaves the role's reach keeps its store
directory forever: it accumulates, and it diverges hosts. Reads a JSON config on stdin:

    {"store": "...", "lock": "...", "whole": [...], "partial": [{"source":..,"skills":[..]}]}

Prints nothing when there is nothing to report, so the caller's gate is `stdout != ""`.

Three reasons a directory qualifies, one per kind of source. They are kept apart on
purpose — the timestamp test is only sound for a source installed with `--all`:

  * source in neither list           — dropped from the role, or hand-installed and never in
                                       it. Either way nothing refreshes it now.
  * whole source (`--all`)           — `skills add` stamps `updatedAt` on every skill the
                                       source currently ships, so an entry left behind at
                                       an older stamp is one upstream no longer ships.
                                       Compared with a tolerance, never for equality: one
                                       run writes a source's skills milliseconds apart
                                       (mattpocock's 37, measured 2026-09-16: .511Z to
                                       .523Z), so an exact test calls every skill but the
                                       last-written one stale. A real orphan is months
                                       away, so the window below separates them with a
                                       margin of four orders of magnitude.
  * partial source (`--skill`)       — only the named skills are fetched, so the timestamp
                                       test would flag every unnamed sibling. The reference
                                       is the configured name list instead. A *named* skill
                                       that upstream withdrew is not reported here: the
                                       role's own install task already fails loudly on it.

Only real directories count. An `~/.agents/skills` entry that is a symlink belongs to
agentstow (authored in ~/github.com/soulmachine/skills), and one that is missing entirely
was already deleted — Q88 removed 28 of those while leaving their lock entries behind, so
without this test they would be reported on every host forever.
