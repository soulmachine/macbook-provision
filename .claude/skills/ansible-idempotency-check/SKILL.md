# Test Role

## Overview

Tests modified Ansible roles for idempotency by running them twice using `ansible localhost -m include_role`. A correct role should produce no changes on the second run.

**Safety warning:** This skill runs roles against the live host — it will install or modify real software on your Mac. Review the role's diff before running.

## When to Use

- After modifying any role under `roles/`
- When asked to test, verify, or validate a role
- Before committing role changes

## Procedure

**Important:** All commands must be run from the git repo root. `cd` there first:

```bash
cd "$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel)"
```

### 1. Detect Changed Roles and Roles Directory

Run `git status --short` and extract both the roles directory path and role names from paths matching `<prefix>/roles/<name>/`.

```bash
git status --short | sed -n 's|.* \(.*/\)\{0,1\}roles/\([^/]*\)/.*|\1roles \2|p' | sort -u
```

Example output (the first field is the roles directory, the second is the role name):

- `roles docker` — roles dir is `roles`, role name is `docker`
- `infra/ansible/roles nodejs` — roles dir is `infra/ansible/roles`, role name is `nodejs`

Extract the roles directory (all changed roles share the same one):

```bash
roles_dir=$(git status --short | sed -n 's|.* \(.*/\)\{0,1\}roles/[^/]*/.*|\1roles|p' | sort -u | head -1)
```

If `roles_dir` is empty, default to `roles`. This captures all statuses (modified, added, renamed, untracked). Deleted roles are included in the output but should be skipped — there is nothing to test.

The `ANSIBLE_ROLES_PATH` env var must be set to the detected roles directory so Ansible can find roles by name.

### 2. First Run — Apply the Role

For each changed role, run it using `include_role`:

```bash
ANSIBLE_ROLES_PATH=./$roles_dir ansible localhost -m include_role -a name=<role-name> -vv
```

Replace `<role-name>` with the actual role name, e.g. `docker`.

**Check the exit code.** If the first run fails (non-zero exit), stop and report the failure. Do not proceed to the second run.

Some roles may require sudo. If you see permission errors, re-run with `--become -K` (or just `--become` if passwordless sudo is configured).

### 3. Second Run — Check Idempotency

Run the same command again, capturing output:

```bash
output=$(ANSIBLE_ROLES_PATH=./$roles_dir ansible localhost -m include_role -a name=<role-name> -vv 2>&1)
echo "$output"
```

Check idempotency by looking for `CHANGED` in the output:

```bash
echo "$output" | grep -c 'CHANGED'
```

- **Count is 0** → Role is idempotent. All tasks report `SUCCESS`.
- **Count > 0** → Role is NOT idempotent. Find which tasks changed:

```bash
echo "$output" | grep 'CHANGED'
```

**Output format reference (`ansible -m include_role` at `-vv`):**

The first result block is always the `include_role` task itself — it always shows `"changed": false` and can be ignored. Subsequent result blocks are the actual role tasks:

- Unchanged tasks: `localhost | SUCCESS => {"changed": false, ...}`
- Changed tasks: `localhost | CHANGED => {"changed": true, ...}`

## Reporting

For each role tested, report:
- Role name
- First run: success/failure (with error summary if failed)
- Second run: idempotent (no changes) or non-idempotent (list which tasks changed)

## Common Causes of Non-Idempotency

- Using `shell`/`command` modules without `creates`/`removes` guards
- Using `state: latest` with Homebrew, pip, or npm (may re-download or report changed when already at latest)
- File operations without proper `when` conditions
- Missing `changed_when: false` on read-only commands (but audit existing uses — `changed_when: false` on a task that actually makes changes hides real non-idempotency)
